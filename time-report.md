# Time Report

2025 - 26th & 27th April
I spent 5 hours on the official main page this weekend & I'm very happy with how it's turning out & to see my visions come to life.
Ended up doing some changes to my original vision, with the pictures. Also had a bit of an issue with spacing, but I will continue on working on it. At least I feel like I have a good starting point & the result so far is very close to the design I planned!

2025 - 30th april
spent the 1.5 hour lesson in school designing a button & starting on my contact form.

2025 - 2th may
I spent 4 hours today creating a logo for my website, adding a few small things to the main page (a new social media icon, change some paddings & margins & adding my logo). I also worked more on my contact form that is coming together nicely. I also love the new look when I added the logo and better spacing on the websites main page, since it looks less empty now! :)

2025 - 3th may
Spent 1 hour today creating a checklist to my webpage. 

2025 - 6th & 7th may
Spent about 7 hours to design a new look to the main page + created an "about" page, + some other small changes.

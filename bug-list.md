# Bug List

> Make a list of the things that don't work as expected. Keep a list of things that you have fixed and try to document how you solved them.

1. I wanted to add a quote slide to the main page to my website & found how to create one on W3schools. I tried to add a html & it it didn't show up as expected on the webpage & there was no text. Had to figure out why and then I saw that I had to add some javascript code as well. I added the javascript code too & it made the quote slide exactly how I wanted it to be.

2. Needed to change the website name letters to all lowercase. The images I'm using in my website right now is not available for everyone, so I need to find a solution for this. My solution was to post my images on imgur & then add the image links from imgur in the html code. 

3. I didn't like the look in the intro section, so I experimented and put the <p> element text within the h2 element, and figured out that was a solution to have both texts "over eachother". Then I could just change the design, font-size etc in CSS, by adding .text-content h2 {} and .text-content p.

4. I wanted to change the background picture on my contact-form & it didn't work out until I added my whole <form> into a <section>. When I did it looked right.

5. I tried to change the background on my Checklist-page & figured out that I had to create a new class, so everything wouldn't get distorted, also since I couldn't use div in the CSS, since I also used a div element in the header.

6. Tried running my website in Lighthouse for the first time & it did not score as high as I wished. So I have a few things I need to correct. 1) Higher contrast in the colors. 2) <meta name="viewport"> tag 3) smaller images and 4) alt attributes on images & a few more small details. My solutions: Changed the color of some quotes for better contrast, added "<meta>" to all pages so they're viewed better on phones & tablets,

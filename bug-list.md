1. I wanted to add a quote slide to the main page to my website & found how to create one on W3schools. I tried to add a html & it it didn't show up as expected on the webpage & there was no text. Had to figure out why and then I saw that I had to add some javascript code as well. I added the javascript code too & it made the quote slide exactly how I wanted it to be.

2. Needed to change the website name letters to all lowercase. The images I'm using in my website right now is not available for everyone, so I need to find a solution for this. My solution:

3. I didn't like the look in the intro section, so I experimented and put the <p> element text within the h2 element, and figured out that was a solution to have both texts "over eachother". Then I could just change the design, font-size etc in CSS, by adding .text-content h2 {} and .text-content p.

4. I wanted to change the background picture on my contact-form & it didn't work out until I added my whole <form> into a <section>. When I did it looked right.

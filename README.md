# Project Summary

It was easy for me to decide what I wanted my website to be about. Figure skating is my biggest passion & favorite sport/hobby in life, so building my own figure skating website & seeing my visions come to life has been an amazing & fun journey. Hopefully the iSKATER website can be used by people who share the same intrest as me &/or want to start. So this website is not only a way for me to keep my love for figure skating alive, but also help other users. It's a project I've been thinking about for a long time, and the Web development course definitely taught me the right tools to create a website like this. My goal was not only to create a website that is nice to look at, but mostly a website that is easy to navigate for my potential users & that bring some sort of value. Which I definitely think I achieved with this project.
